Built a machine learning pipeline to predict customer conversion likelihood using real-world lead data from a financial product dataset.
Performed rigorous EDA, removed noisy entries, imputed missing values, and reduced multicollinearity using VIF filtering.
Applied Chi-Square and ANOVA for feature selection; used one-hot encoding and label encoding to handle categorical data.
Developed and compared multiple models including Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost.
Conducted hyperparameter tuning on XGBoost (720 combinations) using grid search, achieving 91% test accuracy.
